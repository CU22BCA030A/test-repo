# Flask SQL Injection Capture The Flag (CTF)

## Description
This is a Capture The Flag (CTF) project built with Flask that demonstrates various types of SQL Injection vulnerabilities, providing multiple levels of challenges for learning and practice. Each level presents a different challenge:

- **Level 1**: Blind SQL Injection
- **Level 2**: Login Bypass via SQL Injection
- **Level 3**: Union-based SQL Injection and Enumeration

This project is designed for security enthusiasts and learners to practice web application security.

- `config.py`: Configuration file for app settings.
- `login.html`: Login page for Level 2 challenge.
- `credentials.txt`: Contains test credentials (for educational purposes).
- `database.db`: SQLite database used for the challenges (stores user and admin data).
